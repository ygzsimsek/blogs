Colors are more than just visual elements; they are powerful tools that influence human emotions, behaviors, and decisions. When it comes to branding, color psychology plays a pivotal role in shaping how people perceive and connect with a brand. By understanding the psychology of colors, businesses can craft visual identities that resonate with their target audience and convey their desired message effectively.
