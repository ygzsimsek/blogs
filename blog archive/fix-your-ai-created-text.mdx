In the world of AI-generated visuals, one of the most persistent and frustrating challenges has been the generation of coherent text within images. If you've ever tried to create a poster or logo using AI and ended up with gibberish instead of readable text, you're not alone. Many users find this issue not just frustrating but also a significant barrier to effectively using AI for professional purposes.

At Stockimg.ai, we pride ourselves on delivering top-notch AI models, and we have developed a groundbreaking solution to these persistent text generation challenges.  Designed to overcome these challenges, our models transform the way text is integrated into AI visuals, offering a solution that enhances both functionality and creativity. 

In this post, we will explore the root causes of these problems, introduce you to our new models, and tell you how you to fix your AI generated texts. 

## The Text Generation Problem

![comic woman worried](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Abdurrahman-Subh/mdx-blog/main/images/comic-attention.png)

Generating readable and coherent text within AI-generated images is challenging due to several factors:

- **Complexity of Language and Context**
    - Language is inherently complex, with context playing a critical role in meaning. AI models need to understand not just words but also their placement and purpose within an image. This is a daunting task even for advanced AI models.

- **Limitations of Traditional AI Models**
    - Early AI models, such as older versions of DALL-E, often struggled with text generation due to their primary focus on visual elements rather than textual accuracy. As a result, text would often appear as nonsensical scribbles rather than meaningful words.

- **Challenges in Training Data**
    - The training data for many AI models includes a wide array of images but often lacks a sufficient number of examples with clear, well-placed text. This gap in training data can lead to poor performance in text generation.

## Common Frustrations Faced by Users

- **Gibberish Text in Visuals**
    - Users frequently encounter images where the text appears as gibberish. This can be especially frustrating when trying to create visuals that rely heavily on text, such as banners or signage.

- **Inconsistent Font and Style**
    - Even when AI models manage to generate legible text, the style and font can be inconsistent, leading to an unprofessional appearance.

- **Time-Consuming Corrections**
    - Users often have to spend additional time editing images to correct the text, defeating the purpose of using AI to streamline the creative process.

- **Limited Creative Control**
    - The inability to generate precise text limits creative control, hindering users from fully realizing their vision.

## Insights from Industry Experts

According to discussions on platforms like Reddit and insights from industry professionals on LinkedIn and Quora, several strategies can help mitigate these issues:

- **Improved Training Algorithms**
    - Enhancing AI models with better algorithms focused on text recognition and placement can significantly reduce the occurrence of gibberish text.

- **Integration of OCR (Optical Character Recognition)**
    - By incorporating OCR technology, AI models can better understand and replicate text within images, ensuring higher accuracy and readability.

- **User Feedback Loops**
    - Implementing feedback loops where users can correct text errors can help improve AI models over time by providing valuable data for further training.

- **Enhanced Image and Text Pairing Datasets**
    - Increasing the number of training datasets that include clear image-text pairings can improve the models’ ability to generate coherent text.

## Comparing With Other Tools

When creating AI-generated visuals that include text, the choice of model can dramatically affect the quality and clarity of the output. Let's examine how Stockimg.ai’, DALL-E, and Midjourney perform when given the same prompt to *generate a birthday card with the phrase "Happy Birthday, Alex!" prominently displayed*.

#### Image Generated with Stockimg.ai

![Stockimg.ai's Output](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Abdurrahman-Subh/mdx-blog/main/images/alex-stockimg.png)  
*Image created with Stockimg.ai with the prompt "generate a birthday card with the phrase 'Happy Birthday, Alex!' prominently displayed"*

Stockimg.ai generates images that could rival creations made with professional tools like Photoshop or Canva. The text is clear and precisely integrated, making it look effortlessly professional without any need for adjustments.

#### Image Generated with DALL-E

![DALL-E Output](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Abdurrahman-Subh/mdx-blog/main/images/alex-dalle.png)  
*Image created with OpenAI's DALL-E with the prompt "generate a birthday card with the phrase 'Happy Birthday, Alex!' prominently displayed"*

While DALL-E can produce visually intriguing images, it tends to struggle with text clarity, making the output look more like a complex mockup rather than a finished product. The text often appears too intricate, requiring manual tweaking to clarify the message.

#### Image Generated with Midjourney

![Midjourney Output](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Abdurrahman-Subh/mdx-blog/main/images/alex-midjourney.jpeg)
*Image created with Midjourney with the prompt "generate a birthday card with the phrase 'Happy Birthday, Alex!' prominently displayed"*

Midjourney’s outputs are artistically vibrant but often sacrifice functionality for form. The text is frequently unreadable, complicating the design rather than enhancing it. This makes Midjourney less suitable for tasks requiring clear and effective text presentation.

#### Side-by-Side Comparison of All Three Models
