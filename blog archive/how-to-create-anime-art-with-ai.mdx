Want to level up your anime game? Here are some pro tips to make your creations pop:

### 1. Pick a Theme or Setting

Just like *Attack on Titan* wouldn’t be the same without its post-apocalyptic world, picking a setting will help you create a consistent vibe. Want a dark, gritty cyberpunk world like *Psycho-Pass*?

Whether you’re going for the gritty feel of *Berserk* or the sweet, dreamy ambiance of *Your Lie in April*, these filters help you find your perfect aesthetic.

### 3. Focus on Expressions and Emotions

If you’ve watched anime, you know the importance of exaggerated emotions—think of *Attack on Titan’s* intense moments or *Fruits Basket’s* heart-wrenching scenes.
