- **Fantasy and Mythical**: Dragons, elves, enchanted forests—AI can create it all. Try prompts like, *“a mystical forest with glowing trees and magical creatures”*.
- **Anime and Cartoon**: Want to create your very own anime character? Use prompts like, *“anime girl with bob haircut in a flower field, bright pastel colors”*.

Creating the right prompt is key to getting the illustration you want. Here are some tips to help:

- **Be Specific**: Instead of just saying *“dragon,”* try *“a blue dragon resting on a mountain peak, with clouds around”*. Specific details lead to more accurate illustrations.
- **Add Styles or Moods**: Words like “dreamy,” “futuristic,” or “retro” help the AI capture the vibe you’re going for.
- **Include Colors**: If you want certain colors, mention them. For example, *“vivid red and orange sunset over ocean waves”*.
- **Experiment**: Don’t be afraid to try a few versions. The best illustration might come from tweaking your prompt slightly.
