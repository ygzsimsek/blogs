3. **Typography:** Fonts matter in e-commerce logos. Opt for clean, readable fonts. After all, not every shopper is a designer.

4. **Iconography:** Icons are your logo's sidekicks. They convey messages in a glance. Think of the Amazon smile or the eBay shopping cart. Icons are like digital shopping assistants.
