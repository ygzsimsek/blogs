Logos are the unsung heroes of branding. They're like reliable anchors in a sea of marketing noise, silently but powerfully representing your brand. If you're exploring the world of logo design, you've probably heard of wordmark logos.

No, they're not some cryptic code; they're simple text-based logos that make a bold statement. Let's dive in and learn how to create one of these understated yet impactful designs.

## The A, B, C of Wordmark Logos:
- **A is for Appearance:** Wordmark logos are the bookworms of the logo world. It's all about the letters, baby! So, choose a font that suits your brand's personality. Go for something sturdy like a classic serif or keep it casual with a friendly sans-serif.
And remember, no squishing or stretching—your letters have feelings too!
- **B is for Brevity:** Picture this, you're on a roller coaster, and your logo is the safety harness. It needs to hold everything in place without smothering you. Keep it short and sweet.
The fewer words, the better. People remember "Coca-Cola" because it's catchy, not because it's a mouthful.
- **C is for Color:** Now, you don't want your logo to look like a unicorn at a disco, right? Stick to one or two colors that match your brand's vibe. If you're selling rainbows, then go wild. But for the rest of us, simplicity is the name of the game.
