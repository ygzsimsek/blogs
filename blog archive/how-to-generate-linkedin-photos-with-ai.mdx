We’ve all been there. Whether you’re building a personal brand, representing your company, or just trying to make your LinkedIn profile shine, you know the struggle is real. You want a professional photo that makes you look capable and approachable, but who has the time or budget for a professional photoshoot?

If you're ready to make the leap and upgrade your LinkedIn profile picture, Stockimg.ai makes it super simple. Here’s the step-by-step guide to getting that professional photo you’ve always wanted:

1. **Login to Stockimg.ai**

First things first, head over to [Stockimg.ai](https://stockimg.ai) and log in to your account. Don’t have one yet? No worries, you can sign up quickly with your email or use a social login option to speed things up.

2. **Access the Dashboard**

Once logged in, you'll be greeted by the dashboard. It’s an easy-to-navigate interface where you can find all the tools Stockimg.ai has to offer. Head to the **Avatar Category** to get started with generating your LinkedIn photo.

3. **Upload Your Existing Photo**

Pick a photo from your gallery—something that reflects your personality but maybe doesn’t scream "professional." Stockimg.ai works best if your picture is well-lit, so make sure the image is clear and not overly filtered. You don't need to look like you're heading for a magazine cover; think "casual yet confident."

4. **Choose from the Models**

Next, you’ll see a selection of model images that you can use to style your generated headshot. We recommend going for the "Professional Model" option, which is tailor-made for business-like photos. This style ensures a polished result that keeps the focus on you while adding an air of professionalism.

5. **Describe Your Prompt and Generate**

Here’s where the magic happens. Provide a few details about the style of the picture you’re aiming for. You can say things like, "Business casual look, friendly smile, bright background." Stockimg.ai takes your description and transforms your image accordingly. Hit generate, and voilà—you have yourself a LinkedIn-worthy profile picture!
