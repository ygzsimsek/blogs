## Final Thoughts

As an AI enthusiast, I’ve experimented with countless AI tools since their early releases. Throughout the journey, I’ve seen many projects either fall short or shine brightly. OpenAI, without a doubt, has been at the forefront, putting an incredible amount of effort into developing their models.

The new ChatGPT 4o with Canvas is an exciting update, making it simpler to work on code and documents while also streamlining the editing process. I love how seamlessly it allows for refining text without losing context. In previous versions, I often found myself switching back and forth between different chats just to make edits or compare alternative versions. This update has truly simplified my workflow and improved my efficiency.

Of course, it’s important to address the elephant in the room. Despite how integrated large language models (LLMs) have become in our daily lives, there’s still something inherently “off” about AI-generated text—it can sometimes feel a bit unnatural. If you’ve used AI tools before, you probably know what I mean.

That said, AI is still in its infancy, and it’s amazing to witness the rapid advancements these models have made in such a short period of time. It’s clear that even greater changes are on the horizon, and I can’t wait to see what comes next.
