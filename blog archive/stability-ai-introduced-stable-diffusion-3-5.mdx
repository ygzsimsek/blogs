Stable Diffusion is an AI-powered image generation model developed by Stability AI. It uses a machine learning technique called diffusion models, where an image is created by "denoising" random pixels until a coherent and detailed visual emerges based on a text prompt.

It allows creators to input text-based prompts to generate high-quality images, illustrations, and art. Stable Diffusion is widely used across industries, including digital art, game design, marketing, and more, due to its open-source nature and powerful performance.

Since its first release, the model has gained immense popularity for enabling users to generate stunning images with minimal effort. Each update to Stable Diffusion introduces new enhancements, bringing better quality, features, and customization for users. And now, with the release of **Stable Diffusion 3.5**, things have only gotten better!

Now that we covered what is Stable Diffusion models, now that we can move on to the what's new on Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large. 

Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large brings major upgrades like better text rendering, making text elements like signage more accurate. Image quality is improved with sharper details, refined textures, and better color composition. The model also introduces enhanced safety mechanisms to prevent harmful content. It generates more realistic human features, especially in portraits, and handles complex scenes with better consistency, improving multi-character or object interactions.

Let's break down each improvement one by one:

1. **Improved Text Rendering**: One of the most notable updates is better handling of text in images. This means that prompts involving detailed captions, signage, or any other form of textual content will appear more accurately compared to previous models.

2. **Enhanced Image Quality**: The new model also enhances overall image quality. Expect more intricate details, improved color composition, and refined textures, which all contribute to more lifelike and aesthetically pleasing visuals.

3. **Safety Mechanisms**: With SD 3.5, there is a stronger emphasis on ethical AI use. Stability AI has integrated new safety mechanisms designed to prevent harmful or biased content from being generated, ensuring that the tool is safer for a wider range of use cases.

4. **More Detailed Human Features**: The model has been trained to create more accurate human features, such as facial expressions and body proportions. This is especially beneficial for portrait-style prompts, producing images that are more realistic and visually striking.

5. **Consistency in Complex Scenarios**: SD 3.5 Large is better at understanding and maintaining context in complex scenarios. Whether it's creating multi-character scenes or generating specific objects in relation to one another, this version handles such tasks more smoothly than ever.
