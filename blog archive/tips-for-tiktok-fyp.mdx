Being featured on the FYP can:

- **Increase Your Earnings**: More views can translate to more followers, and once you hit 10,000 followers, you can start earning from the TikTok Creator Fund. Cha-ching!
- **Attract Sponsorships**: Brands love popular accounts. Being on the FYP can make you a hot commodity for sponsorships.

### Consistently Post at the Right Time

Consistency is key, but timing is everything. Posting regularly keeps you in the algorithm’s good graces. But don't just post for the sake of posting; make sure your content is top-notch.

To nail your timing:

- **Post When Your Audience is Online**: Use tools or switch to a TikTok Pro account to find out when your followers are most active.
- **Align With Time Zones**: If your audience is spread across different time zones, adjust your posting schedule accordingly.

### Use Trending Hashtags

Hashtags on TikTok are like secret handshakes. Using trending ones helps categorize your content and boosts discoverability. Aim for 3-6 relevant hashtags rather than stuffing your post with every trending tag.

- **Research Trending Tags**: Check out what hashtags popular videos in your niche are using.
- **Avoid Overuse**: Just because #fyp is trending doesn’t mean it will guarantee your spot on the FYP.

### Use Trending Audio Clips or Video Effects

Music and sounds are integral to TikTok videos. Using trending audio clips can make your content more discoverable.

- **Explore the Sounds Library**: Check out TikTok’s ‘Discover’ page for popular audio clips.
- **Save and Use**: Bookmark trending sounds and effects for future videos.

### Write Short, Interesting Captions

Captions may be limited to 150 characters, but they’re crucial for engagement. Craft captions that spark curiosity or encourage interaction.

- **Be Intriguing**: Use captions that make viewers want to watch till the end.
- **Ask Questions**: Engage your audience by asking questions or teasing content.
