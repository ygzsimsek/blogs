**A mockup** is a realistic model or draft of a product that helps designers and clients see what the final version might look like. It is often used to showcase **website designs, product images, apparel designs, and branding elements**. Mockups are essential in product design because they bring a sense of tangibility to concepts that are still in development.

Traditionally, creating a mockup involved software like Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop, and required a solid knowledge of design tools. However, with the rise of AI, **creating mockups has become more accessible**, allowing even non-designers to create professional-looking visuals without needing extensive training.

## The Importance of Mockups in Design

- **Gather Feedback**: Mockups are easy to share with clients or stakeholders, allowing for quick feedback and ensuring alignment before moving to the final stages.
- **Save Time and Money**: With the ability to catch flaws and make changes during the mockup stage, costly mistakes can be avoided during production.
