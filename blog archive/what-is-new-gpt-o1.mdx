OpenAI has once again pushed the boundaries of artificial intelligence with the launch of its groundbreaking ChatGPT o1 series. Previously known under the codename "Strawberry," the o1 models bring a fresh wave of innovation to the AI landscape. 

With o1-preview, the flagship model, and its nimble sibling o1-mini, designed for high-efficiency code generation, this new series isn’t just another upgrade—it’s a complete reimagining of how AI can reason, problem-solve, and enhance human productivity.

But this isn’t just about raw power or speed—what makes the o1 series truly revolutionary is its ability to "think" before responding. Unlike earlier models, o1 breaks down complex tasks step by step, delivering answers with enhanced accuracy and depth. 

This is all thanks to its sophisticated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, a next-level feature that helps the models dissect difficult queries much like a human would.

In this blog, we’re diving deep into what makes the o1 series a game-changer. We’ll break down its key features, explore how it stacks up against previous models like GPT-4o, and uncover the tech behind its exceptional reasoning skills.

## Meet the o1 Family

The o1 series isn't just a lone ranger; it's a family affair:

- **o1-preview**: The flagship model that's redefining AI reasoning.
- **o1-mini**: The leaner, meaner sibling optimized for code generation.

Both models are now available on ChatGPT and through OpenAI's API. But here's the kicker—they're not just faster or bigger; they're **smarter**.

## Key Features of New GPT o1

The o1 models are distinguished by their ability to "think" before responding to queries, setting them apart from previous generative AI models. This enhanced reasoning capability allows the models to break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps, improving the accuracy and depth of their responses.

One of the core contributors to o1's reasoning prowess is the use of a machine learning approach known as Chain-of-Thought (CoT). This technique enables large language models to dissect complex problems and tackle them step by step, much like human problem-solving processes. The CoT mechanism in o1 was developed using reinforcement learning, where the model was rewarded for correct answers and penalized when it did not know the answer.

According to Noam Brown, a research scientist at OpenAI, training o1 with reinforcement learning taught the system to think through a special chain of thought before responding. Brown notes that "the longer o1 thinks, the better it performs on tasks requiring reasoning."

## Why o1 Is a Big Deal

So, what's the buzz all about? The o1 models have a unique superpower: they **"think" before they respond**. Yes, you read that right. They're channeling their inner philosopher, taking a moment to contemplate before laying down some wisdom.

### The Magic of Chain-of-Thought (CoT)

At the heart of o1's thoughtfulness is a technique called **Chain-of-Thought**. Think of it as the AI equivalent of showing your work in math class. Instead of jumping straight to the answer, o1 breaks down complex problems into bite-sized pieces, tackling them step by step.

- **Reinforcement Learning**: o1 was trained to be a thinking machine using reinforcement learning. It got high-fives for correct answers and time-outs for mistakes.
- **Deep Reasoning**: This approach allows o1 to delve deeper into problems, improving accuracy and providing more insightful responses.

## Mind-Blowing Performance (not fast tho)

The o1 models have demonstrated remarkable performance across various benchmarks:

- **International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) Qualifying Exam:** In simulations of this prestigious high school mathematics competition, o1 correctly solved 83% of the problems, significantly outperforming GPT-4o, which solved only 13%.

- **Codeforces Programming Challenges:** o1 reached the 89th percentile on Codeforces, an online competitive programming platform, surpassing DeepMind's flagship system AlphaCode 2.

- **GPQA Diamond Benchmark:** In tackling this set of complex physics, biology, and chemistry questions, o1-preview achieved a higher score than a group of PhD-level experts.

These results highlight o1's superior ability in tasks that require deep reasoning and problem-solving skills.

## Access Granted (Sort Of)

If you're itching to test drive o1, here's what you need to know:

- **Available To**: ChatGPT Plus and Team subscribers.
- **Coming Soon**: Corporate and educational users will get access next week.
- **Future Plans**: OpenAI aims to roll out **o1-mini** to all free ChatGPT users. Stay tuned!

## Comparing o1 and GPT-4o

### What's Missing in o1?

While o1 is flexing its reasoning muscles, it's not quite the jack-of-all-trades—yet.

- **No Internet Browsing**: Unlike GPT-4o, o1 can't surf the web.
- **No File Analysis**: File what? o1 isn't into that scene.
- **Image Analysis**: It has the capability, but it's currently on pause for extra tinkering.

### The Price of Genius

Quality comes at a cost, and o1 is no exception.

- **Pricing**:
  - **o1-preview**: $15 per million input tokens and $60 per million output tokens.
  - That's **3x more for input** and **4x more for output** compared to GPT-4o.
- **Message Limits**:
  - **o1-preview**: 30 messages per week.
  - **o1-mini**: 50 messages per week.

Think of it as paying for first-class instead of economy—more expensive, but you get the VIP treatment.

## The Challanges

![robot sad](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Abdurrahman-Subh/mdx-blog/main/images/robot-sad.png)

No AI is perfect, and o1 has its share of quirks.

- **Speed Bumps:** Some users report that o1 can take over **10 seconds** to respond. Patience is a virtue, right?

- **Hallucinations:** According to OpenAI's own technical paper, o1 might occasionally go off the rails, providing answers that are... well, let's just say "creative."

- **Reluctant to Admit Ignorance:** Testers have noted that o1 is less likely to say "I don't know." Confidence is great, but sometimes a little humility goes a long way.

### Multilingual Support and Coding Skills

- **Language Skills:** o1 isn't just a one-language wonder. It outperforms GPT-4o in languages like **Arabic** and **Korean**, making it a global player.

- **Coding Capabilities:** When paired with **GitHub Copilot**, o1 shines in optimizing algorithms and refining application code. Developers, rejoice!

## Peeking into the Future

OpenAI isn't resting on its laurels, and neither is the competition.

- **Google DeepMind**: They've published studies showing that giving AI models more time to compute and guiding their responses can boost performance without extra tweaking.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Expect more features and enhancements in future o1 updates.

## Wrapping It Up

OpenAI's o1 series is a game-changer, pushing the boundaries of what AI can do. By introducing a model that takes the time to **think before it speaks**, we're entering a new era of AI that values reasoning over regurgitation.

### The Big Picture

- **Specialization**: o1 represents a move towards specialized AI models tailored for complex tasks.
- **Ethical Considerations**: With great power comes great responsibility. As AI models become more advanced, we need to navigate the ethical implications carefully.
- **Augmenting, Not Replacing**: The goal isn't to replace human thought but to augment it. Tools like o1 can help us solve problems that were previously out of reach.

## Final Thoughts

The o1 models are like that brilliant friend who might take a moment longer to answer but always leaves you impressed with their insight. They're not here to replace the quick chatbots we use daily but to tackle the tough questions that require a deeper level of understanding.

So, next time you have a complex problem that needs some heavy lifting, consider giving o1 a spin. Just be prepared to wait a few extra seconds—and maybe pay a bit more—for that Eureka moment.

Stay curious, and keep exploring the fascinating world of AI!
