## Why Timing on LinkedIn Matters

When is the best time to post on LinkedIn? That’s a question every LinkedIn user has asked at some point. While content quality matters, timing can determine whether your post gets noticed or buried. Think of it this way: posting at the wrong time is like throwing a party when everyone’s already asleep.

The best time to post on LinkedIn depends on various factors like your audience, industry, and even the time zone they’re in. If you want your posts to appear in more feeds, you’ve got to sync up with when people are actually active on the platform.

## So, What’s the Best Time to Post on LinkedIn?

Let’s get right to it. Based on research and trends, the best time to post on LinkedIn is typically between 8:00 AM and 10:00 AM on weekdays. This is when professionals are just starting their day, grabbing a coffee, and scrolling through their feed. Early morning posts have a higher chance of catching people before they dive into their workday chaos.

However, this doesn’t mean you should only post in the morning. The second-best time to post is around lunchtime, between 12:00 PM and 1:00 PM. Think about it—people are taking breaks, munching on their sandwiches, and casually browsing their LinkedIn feed. These are prime windows to get your content in front of the right eyes.

## Best Days and Times to Post on LinkedIn: A Breakdown

Not all days are created equal. The best days and times to post on LinkedIn revolve around mid-week, with Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday reigning supreme. Why? Early in the week, people are getting into the work groove, and by midweek, they’re fully engaged. Posting on Monday can be a bit tricky—most are catching up from the weekend, and your post might get lost in the shuffle. But don’t count Monday out just yet! Posting around 10:00 AM on Monday can still work well, as some professionals start their week by checking their LinkedIn.

Friday, on the other hand, is a wildcard. The best time to post on LinkedIn on Friday is typically earlier in the day, around 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM. By the afternoon, people are mentally checking out for the weekend. If your post hits too late, it’s like trying to talk about work at a Friday night happy hour—not the best timing, right?

## When Not to Post on LinkedIn: Avoiding the Dead Zones

Now that we’ve covered the best times to post on LinkedIn, let’s talk about the worst times. Weekends? Not so great. Unless your audience is full of weekend warriors who never take a break, your post will likely get lost in the noise. The best time to post on LinkedIn on Saturday or Sunday? Honestly, there isn’t one. The engagement rates tend to plummet during weekends, as most professionals are busy recharging for the week ahead.

Late evenings, after 8:00 PM, are also considered dead zones. People are unwinding, binge-watching their favorite shows, or spending time with family. The best times to post on LinkedIn typically align with work hours and routines.

## Special Days to Watch: Posting on LinkedIn During the Holidays

Holidays can be tricky when it comes to LinkedIn. Most people are away from their desks and less likely to engage. The best time to post on LinkedIn during holidays is typically before the break starts, ideally on the last working day around mid-morning. This way, your post catches people before they log off for vacation.

Post-holiday blues? The first workday back is another excellent opportunity to post. People are refreshed, back at work, and ready to engage with new content. Use this time wisely to share thought leadership or announcements.

Experiment with these time slots, track your results, and adjust as necessary. Whether you're sharing a new job announcement or just showing off your latest achievements, timing your post right will maximize its impact. And remember, LinkedIn success is a marathon, not a sprint!
