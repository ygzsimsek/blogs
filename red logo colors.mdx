Not all reds are created equal. Depending on the mood and industry, different shades of red can be employed:

## Tips for Using Red in Logos

2. **Pair with Contrasting Colors:** Colors like green (`#00FF00`) or teal (`#008080`) can make red pop while maintaining harmony.
3. **Consider Cultural Implications:** Red has different meanings across cultures. In China, it symbolizes luck, while in Western cultures, it often represents love or urgency.

### Create Contrast
Use complementary colors like green (`#00FF00`) or turquoise (`#40E0D0`) to make red stand out even more. This creates visual harmony and prevents the design from appearing flat.

### Match Your Brand Personality
- **Energetic and Bold:** Use bright red with orange or yellow.
- **Elegant and Professional:** Pair darker shades like crimson with gold or navy blue.
- **Modern and Minimal:** Use red sparingly alongside black, white, or gray.

### Leverage Gradients
Adding gradients to your red-based logo can introduce depth and complexity. For example, blending bright red (`#FF0000`) with orange (`#FFA500`) creates a fiery, energetic effect.
